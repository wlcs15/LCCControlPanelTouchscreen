# ESP32-S3 LCC Turnout Control Panel — Specification

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This project implements an ESP32-S3–based LCC turnout control panel with a touch LCD user interface.

The device:
- Connects to an LCC/OpenLCB CAN bus using OpenMRN
- Sends and receives turnout control events
- Provides a touchscreen interface for turnout monitoring and control
- Stores configuration and turnout definitions on an SD card
- Uses ESP-IDF v5.1.6, FreeRTOS, LVGL, and OpenMRN

Out of scope:
- Acting as a turnout decoder (motor driver)
- Direct servo/motor control
- Signal or lighting control

---

## 2. Target Platform and Constraints

### Hardware
- Board: Waveshare ESP32-S3 Touch LCD 4.3B
- MCU: ESP32-S3
- Display: RGB LCD with backlight via CH422G I/O expander
- Touch: Capacitive
- Storage: SD card (SPI, CS via CH422G)
- CAN: LCC bus via onboard CAN transceiver

### Software Stack
- ESP-IDF: v5.1.6 (mandatory — see Build Notes below)
- RTOS: FreeRTOS
- UI: LVGL 8.x (via ESP-IDF component registry)
- LCC: OpenMRN (git submodule at `components/OpenMRN`)
- Filesystem: FATFS on SD card
- Image decoding: esp_jpeg (ESP-IDF component)

### Build Notes

**ESP-IDF Version Constraint**: This project requires **ESP-IDF 5.1.6** (GCC 12.2.0). 
ESP-IDF 5.3+ (GCC 13.x) and 5.4+ (GCC 14.x) have a newlib/libstdc++ incompatibility 
that causes OpenMRN compilation failures with errors in `<bits/char_traits.h>` 
related to `std::construct_at` and `std::pointer_traits::pointer_to`.

**Windows Symlink Fix**: On Windows, the files in `components/OpenMRN/include/esp-idf/` 
may appear as plain text files containing relative paths (broken Unix symlinks). 
These must be converted to proper C `#include` wrapper files. Example:
```c
// components/OpenMRN/include/esp-idf/openmrn_features.h
// Wrapper for esp-idf platform - include parent openmrn_features.h
#include "../openmrn_features.h"
```

**WiFi Driver Exclusion**: `EspIdfWiFi.cxx` uses ESP-IDF 5.3+ APIs (`channel_bitmap`, 
`WIFI_EVENT_HOME_CHANNEL_CHANGE`) and must be excluded from the build in 
`components/OpenMRN/CMakeLists.txt` when using ESP-IDF 5.1.6. STA join uses 
`main/wifi/` (host wrap + `esp_wifi`) instead.

**FAT Long Filename Support**: `turnouts.json` requires FAT LFN support. Enable in 
`sdkconfig`:
```
CONFIG_FATFS_LFN_HEAP=y
CONFIG_FATFS_MAX_LFN=255
```

### Hard Constraints
- LVGL calls must only occur from the UI task
- SD card I/O must not occur in the UI task
- CAN traffic must obey defined rate limits
- Turnout file writes must be atomic

---

## 3. LCC Event Model (Authoritative)

### 3.1 Turnout Event Pairs

Each turnout is defined by two 64-bit LCC event IDs:
- **Normal Event**: Produced when closing turnout, consumed to detect closed state
- **Reverse Event**: Produced when throwing turnout, consumed to detect thrown state

Event IDs are fully user-configurable per turnout and stored in `turnouts.json`.

### 3.2 Event Consumption

The panel acts as an event consumer for state feedback:

| Message Type | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| EventReport | Update turnout state (Normal or Reverse) based on which event was received |
| ProducerIdentified (valid) | Update turnout state from query response (only VALID state is processed; INVALID responses are ignored) |
| IdentifyConsumer | Respond with ConsumerIdentified for registered events |
| IdentifyGlobal | Respond with ConsumerIdentified for all registered events |

### 3.3 Event Production

When the user taps a turnout tile, the panel sends a single event:
- Current state NORMAL → send Reverse event (to throw)
- Current state REVERSE, UNKNOWN, or STALE → send Normal event (to close)

### 3.4 State Query Protocol

On startup, the panel queries turnout positions:
1. For each registered turnout, send `IdentifyConsumer` for both Normal and Reverse events
2. Queries are paced at configurable interval (default 100ms) to avoid bus congestion
3. Turnout decoders respond with `ProducerIdentified` messages (one per event, with VALID or INVALID state)
4. Only `ProducerIdentified` messages with `EventState::VALID` are used to update tile state; `INVALID` responses are discarded
5. Panel updates tile colors based on responses

### 3.5 Discovery Mode

When enabled, the panel captures all `EventReport` messages on the bus regardless
of registration. This allows users to identify event IDs by operating turnouts
manually and observing which events appear.

---

## 4. Configuration Files

### File: `nodeid.txt` (SD Card)

Plain text file containing the 6-byte LCC node ID in dotted hex format:
```
05.01.01.01.9F.60.00
```

Rules:
- Read at boot before LCC initialization
- Missing file causes SD card error screen
- Changes require device restart

### LCC Configuration (CDI/ACDI)

The device uses OpenMRN's CDI (Configuration Description Information) for:
- **Panel Settings**: Screen timeout, stale timeout, query pace
- **User Name/Description**: Stored in ACDI user space (space 251)

**CDI Memory Layout (PanelConfig):**
| Offset | Size | Content |
|--------|------|---------|
| 0 | 4 | InternalConfigData (version, etc.) |
| 4 | 2 | Screen Backlight Timeout (seconds, 0=disabled, 10-3600) |
| 6 | 2 | Stale Timeout (seconds, 0=disabled, 0-65535) |
| 8 | 2 | Query Pace (milliseconds, 10-5000) |

**Panel Configuration:**
| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Screen Timeout | 60 | 0, 10-3600 | Backlight timeout in seconds (0=disabled) |
| Stale Timeout | 300 | 0-65535 | Seconds without update before turnout marked stale (0=disabled) |
| Query Pace | 100 | 10-5000 | Milliseconds between event queries at startup |

**SNIP (Simple Node Information Protocol):**
- Manufacturer: "IvanBuilds"
- Model: "LCC Turnout Panel"
- Hardware Version: "ESP32S3 LCD 4.3B"
- Software Version: "1.0.0"

**Implementation Note:** User info (name/description) uses `space="251"` (ACDI user
space) with `origin="1"` to avoid conflicts with manufacturer info at origin 0.

## 5. Turnout File Format

### File: `turnouts.json`

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "turnouts": [
    {
      "name": "Main Yard Lead",
      "event_normal": "05.01.01.01.40.00.00.00",
      "event_reverse": "05.01.01.01.40.00.00.01"
    },
    {
      "name": "Siding Switch",
      "event_normal": "05.01.01.01.40.00.01.00",
      "event_reverse": "05.01.01.01.40.00.01.01"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:
- Event IDs are 8-byte values in dotted hex format
- Turnout names should be unique (for user clarity)
- Maximum 150 turnouts supported
- Writes must be atomic (full file rewrite)
- Version mismatches must be detected

### File: `panel.json` (SD Card)

Stores the control panel layout (placed turnouts, track endpoints, track segments).
Turnouts are keyed by their stable `turnout_id` (uint32 auto-increment key from
`turnout_manager`). Track endpoints use a tagged-union reference format:
`"turnout:N"` or `"endpoint:N"`.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "items": [
    {
      "turnout_id": 1,
      "grid_x": 10,
      "grid_y": 5,
      "rotation": 0,
      "mirrored": false
    }
  ],
  "endpoints": [
    { "id": 1, "grid_x": 15, "grid_y": 5 }
  ],
  "next_endpoint_id": 2,
  "tracks": [
    {
      "from": "turnout:1",
      "from_point": "entry",
      "to": "endpoint:1",
      "to_point": "entry"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:
- Loaded at startup after turnouts.json
- Saved explicitly by user via the "Save" button in the Panel Builder
- Maximum items/endpoints/tracks governed by `PANEL_MAX_ITEMS` (50),
  `PANEL_MAX_ENDPOINTS` (20), `PANEL_MAX_TRACKS` (100)

## 6. Functional Requirements

### Boot

#### FR-001
Display splashscreen.jpg from SD at boot using esp_jpeg decoder.
AC: Displayed within 1500 ms or fallback shown.

#### FR-002
Initialize OpenMRN using Node ID from SD card `/sdcard/nodeid.txt`.
AC: Node visible on LCC network with configured ID.

#### FR-003
Transition to the panel screen (control panel view) within 5 s of LCC readiness
or timeout. If the panel layout is empty, redirect to the settings screen instead.

#### FR-004
If SD card is not detected at boot, display error screen with:
- Warning icon and "SD Card Not Detected" title
- Instructions listing required files (nodeid.txt, turnouts.json)
- Screen persists until device restart

**Implementation Note:** SD card retry is not performed after error screen is shown
because `waveshare_sd_init()` reinitializes CH422G and SPI, which interferes with
the RGB LCD display operation. User must insert card and restart device.

#### FR-005
Screen backlight timeout for power saving:
- Configurable timeout via LCC configuration (default: 60 seconds)
- Set to 0 to disable timeout (always on)
- Minimum enabled timeout: 10 seconds, maximum: 3600 seconds
- Touch-to-wake: Any touch restores backlight immediately
- Backlight is on/off only (not dimmable - hardware limitation)

AC: Backlight turns off after configured idle period; touch wakes screen.

#### FR-006
On boot, query all registered turnout positions:
- Send IdentifyConsumer for each registered turnout event
- Pace queries at configurable interval (default 100ms)
- Update tile states as responses arrive

AC: Turnout tiles reflect current positions within a few seconds of boot.

### Screen Layout

#### FR-010
The application has two screens:
- **Panel Screen** (default boot screen): Live control panel diagram showing placed
  turnouts as Y-shapes with color-coded state and track segments on a full-screen
  canvas. Floating settings gear icon in the upper-right for navigation.
- **Settings Screen**: Three-tab tabview (Turnouts, Add Turnout, Panel Builder)
  with a back button to return to the panel screen.

AC: Panel screen shown on boot (or settings screen if layout is empty). Settings
gear navigates to settings. Back button returns to panel.

### Turnout Switchboard

#### FR-020
Display a grid of color-coded turnout tiles loaded from turnouts.json.
- Tiles are 150×110 pixels in a flex-wrap layout
- Each tile shows three rows: turnout name (top), current state text (center), edit/delete buttons (bottom)
- State text uses "CLOSED" / "THROWN" / "UNKNOWN" / "STALE"
- Green = Closed, Yellow = Thrown, Grey = Unknown, Red = Stale

AC: All registered turnouts are shown with correct color coding.

#### FR-021
Tapping a turnout tile toggles its state:
- If NORMAL → send Reverse event
- If REVERSE/UNKNOWN/STALE → send Normal event
- Mark tile as pending (blue border) until state feedback received

AC: Tile sends correct event and shows pending indicator.

#### FR-022
Update tile state in real-time as EventReport and ProducerIdentified messages arrive.
AC: Tile color changes within one LVGL refresh cycle of event reception.

#### FR-023
Mark turnouts as STALE when no state update received within configurable timeout.
AC: Tile turns red after stale timeout expires without any state update.

#### FR-024
Provide an "Edit Turnout" dialog via the edit icon button on each tile:
- Tapping the edit icon opens a full-screen modal with:
  - A text input pre-filled with the current turnout name
  - A "Flip Polarity" button (amber, with refresh icon) that swaps the Normal
    and Reverse event IDs. If the turnout is placed on the panel, the panel
    layout item's `event_normal` key is updated accordingly. LCC event
    registrations are refreshed and both turnouts.json and panel.json are saved.
  - Save and Cancel buttons
- On-screen keyboard for name editing
- Save persists the new name to SD card and updates the tile label
- Cancel closes the modal without changes

AC: Renamed turnout is saved to turnouts.json and tile label updates immediately.
Flipped turnout has swapped event IDs, updated panel key, and re-registered LCC events.

#### FR-025
Provide inline delete for each turnout via a trash icon button on the tile:
- Tapping the trash icon opens a confirmation dialog with warning styling
- Dialog shows turnout name and "This action cannot be undone" message
- Confirm removes the turnout, unregisters its LCC events, removes any matching
  panel layout item (cascade-deleting connected tracks), saves both turnouts.json
  and panel.json, and refreshes the grid
- Cancel closes the dialog without changes

AC: Deleted turnout is removed from turnouts.json, its panel item (if any) is
removed from panel.json, and it disappears from the grid.

#### FR-026
Support JMRI roster.xml import:
- On startup, if `/sdcard/roster.xml` exists, parse the OlcbTurnoutManager section
- Extract turnout definitions (systemName event pairs + userName)
- Respect the `inverted` attribute (swap Normal/Reverse events when true)
- Skip turnouts whose event IDs already exist in the turnout list
- Append newly discovered turnouts and save the merged list to turnouts.json

AC: Turnouts defined in JMRI roster.xml appear on the Turnouts tab after reboot with the file on SD card.

### Add Turnout

#### FR-030
Provide manual turnout entry form with:
- Name text input
- Normal Event ID text input (dotted hex format)
- Swap button (amber, between Normal and Reverse fields) to swap the contents
  of the two event ID fields before adding
- Reverse Event ID text input (dotted hex format)
- On-screen keyboard for text entry
- Add button to save turnout

AC: Valid turnout is added to turnouts.json and appears on Turnouts tab.

#### FR-031
Provide discovery mode toggle:
- When enabled, capture all EventReport messages on the bus
- Display discovered events in a scrollable list
- User can select events from the list to populate the form

AC: Events seen on bus appear in discovery list within 1 second.

### Panel Screen

#### FR-040
Display placed turnouts as Y-shape symbols with color-coded state:
- Green = Closed (Normal), Red = Thrown (Reverse), Grey = Unknown/Stale
- Track segments drawn between connected endpoints
- Layout auto-scaled and centered to fill the full 800×480 screen with 20px margins
- Line widths and touch hitbox sizes scale proportionally (minimum 2px / 40×30)
- Tapping a turnout Y-shape toggles its state (same logic as FR-021)

AC: All placed turnouts visible with correct colors, maximally sized; tap toggles state.

#### FR-041
Update turnout colors on the panel screen in real-time as LCC events arrive.
AC: Color changes within one LVGL refresh cycle.

### Panel Builder

#### FR-042
Provide a WYSIWYG editor (Panel Builder tab in settings) for designing the
control panel layout, with:
- Left sidebar: zoom controls (0.5×–2.0×), pan/home buttons (bottom-aligned),
  mode buttons (Place Turnout, Place Endpoint, Delete, Save)
- Canvas area: 800×480 pixels with 20px grid snapping
- Place turnouts from a roller filtered to unplaced turnouts only
- Place track endpoints on turnout connection points (Normal/Reverse/Root)
- Auto-connect endpoints to form track segments
- Drag to reposition placed items
- Delete with cascade removal of connected endpoints and tracks
- Auto-center view to fit all placed items

AC: Layout designed in builder matches what appears on the panel screen.

#### FR-043
Save the panel layout to `/sdcard/panel.json` when the user taps "Save".
Load the layout from SD card at startup.

AC: Layout persists across reboots.

### CAN Rate Limiting

#### FR-050
Minimum transmission interval: configurable (default 20ms).
